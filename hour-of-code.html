                <p><h2>Introduction</h2>
                    On November 5th, 2024, between 16:00 and 18:00 our team organized an Hour of Code event among twenty 7th grade schoolchildren in Aghdam District Secondary School No. 88 in Garadagh. The event started with a brief introduction of ADA University and question-answer session with schoolchildren. Then, our team proceeded by explaining basic coding blocks on code.org, and consequently, described strategies on how to successfully finish the assigned challenge. Afterwards, we shared the Hour of Code code.org link and assisted students with proceeding through the challenge levels. In the end, we awarded the completion certificates and took a group photo with the students.
                    <h2>About Community</h2>
                    The chosen community for this assignment was Aghdam District Secondary School No. 88 in Garadagh. The reason why this school was chosen lies in the fact that one of our team members (Orkhan Nabiyev) used to study in this school and had previous connections with the teachers and administration there. Secondly, the Hour of Code event was previously not taught in this school, and it lacked previous experience and awareness with such digital-literacy events. In addition, it was the first time for schoolchildren and participants of this school to receive such an engaging event, where they can apply their computing skills hands-on and engage with their knowledge in real-life scenarios. Considering all of the mentioned points, we believe that organizing our event in this particular community had a greater long-term impact compared to other communities, where schoolchildren were exposed to new opportunities and perspectives.

                    <p class="fig_words">
                        The event started with a brief introduction of ADA University, presenting the universityâ€™s vision, values, faculties, activities, and success stories of students. During the introductory session, schoolchildren were asked their background knowledge on ADA University and whether they are eager to continue their studies at our university. During this part, pupils were eager to engage with us, shared their opinions and future academic plans, and some participants explained the reasons why ADA would be their desired place to study.

                    <p class="fig_words">
                        Afterwards, we proceeded with the coding part of the event, where participants were required to complete the coding challenges on code.org. We first told the pupils to scan the QR code we prepared to access the website and then explained how they need to align the phones (horizontally) to be able to finish the challenges without technical issues. Due to unavailability of computers in school, pupils were required to access the website through their phones.

                    <p class="fig_words">
                        We also helped students to connect to our hotspot WI-FI networks to be able to access the website. Consequently, after resolving technical issues, our team explained the basic coding blocks on code.org (the principals of action, conditional branching and loop blocks). After finalizing this part, participants were required to complete the challenges by asking questions and following instructions.

                        During this activity, our team assisted schoolchildren in their questions and possible technical issues, and helped students to proceed through the levels. After all schoolchildren completed their challenges, our team distributed certificates to participants, and received their impressions and feedback about the event. Participants showcased enthusiasm and excitement in completing the levels and helped each other in accomplishing the tasks. They shared that they would like to participate in more of similar events to enhance their skills and engage in interactive learning activities.
